**Inference Code for RNA Sequence Design**

This repository contains the inference code for Struct2SeQ, a deep reinforcement learning framework that generates RNA sequences conditioned on target secondary structures and SHAPE reactivity constraints. The model uses deep Q-learning to design sequences that fold into desired structures, including complex pseudoknots.

## Overview

Struct2SeQ formulates RNA sequence design as a sequential decision-making process, using a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture trained with deep Q-learning. The model learns to construct sequences that:
- Fold into intended secondary structures (including pseudoknots)
- Exhibit experimentally consistent SHAPE reactivity profiles
- Explore diverse sequence space while maintaining structural accuracy

In the OpenKnot challenges, Struct2SeQ achieved human-level performance on pseudoknot design tasks while generating substantially more diverse solutions than human players.

## Key Features

- **Deep Q-Learning Framework**: Uses reinforcement learning to learn structure-conditioned sequence generation
- **Multiple Sampling Strategies**: 
  - Greedy sampling with varying exploration (p=0.05, 0.1)
  - Stochastic sampling for diversity
  - Optional beam search (top-k)
- **Wildtype Sequence Bias**: Optionally biases generation toward reference sequences
- **Rescue Mechanism**: Targeted mutation strategy for near-perfect sequences
- **SHAPE Profile Integration**: Generates and evaluates SHAPE reactivity profiles
- **Pseudoknot Support**: Handles complex RNA structures including pseudoknots
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing of multiple target structures

## Performance

- **OpenKnot Round 7 (100mer)**: 19/20 puzzles solved, human-competitive performance
- **OpenKnot Round 7b (240mer)**: Significantly outperformed human players (p=0.024)
- **Sequence Diversity**: Generates solutions averaging >50 mutations from wildtype
- **Throughput**: Orders of magnitude more unique solutions than human designers

## Installation and run instructions

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Shujun-He/Struct2SeQ
cd Struct2SeQ
```

2. Download model weights (via Kaggle)

Make sure you have the Kaggle CLI configured (~/.kaggle/kaggle.json).
```
kaggle datasets download -d shujun717/struct2seq-weights
kaggle datasets download -d shujun717/ribonanzanet-weights
```

Unzip the downloaded files:

```
unzip struct2seq-weights.zip
unzip ribonanzanet-weights.zip
```

This should produce the following key files:

```
Struct2SeQ.pt
Struct2SeQ_SHAPE.pt
RibonanzaNet.pt
RibonanzaNet-SS.pt
```

3. Create and activate the Conda environment
```
conda create -n struct2seq python=3.11
conda activate struct2seq
conda install pip
```

Install required Python dependencies:

```
pip install \
    torch \
    polars \
    numpy \
    matplotlib \
    tqdm \
    arnie==0.1.9 \
    PyYAML \

### Required Arguments

- `--target_df`: Path to input CSV file containing target structures
  - Must have columns: `Title`, `Dot-bracket`, `wild_type_sequence`
- `--output_csv`: Filename for output CSV (default: `output.csv`)
- `--up_bias`: How much to upweight Wildtype Sequence, should be a value between 0 and 1 where 0 is no upweight and 1 will upweight WT significantly


### Optional Arguments

- `--gpu_id`: GPU device ID (default: `0`)
- `--n_structures`: Number of structures to process (default: `100`)
- `--out_folder`: Output directory for results (default: `results`)

## Input Format

The input CSV file must contain the following columns:

| Column | Description | Format |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `Title` | Unique identifier for each structure | String |
| `Dot-bracket` | Target secondary structure | Dot-bracket notation (e.g., `(((...)))`) |
| `wild_type_sequence` | Reference RNA sequence (optional) | ACGU nucleotides |

### Dot-Bracket Notation
- `(` and `)` - Base pairs
- `.` - Unpaired nucleotides
- Pseudoknots supported via extended notation

### Example Input
```csv
Title,Dot-bracket,wild_type_sequence
Pseudoknot_1,(((...[[[)))...]]]...,GCCCAAAUUUGGGAAACCCAAA
Hairpin_1,((((....)))),GGGGAAAACCCC
```

## Output Format

The output CSV contains comprehensive results for all generated sequences:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `sequence` | Designed RNA sequence (ACGU) |
| `predicted_structure` | Predicted secondary structure (dot-bracket) |
| `source` | Structure identifier from input (Title) |

| `target_structure` | Target secondary structure from input |
| `jaccard` | Jaccard similarity between predicted and target base pairs (0-1) |
| `structure_match` | Boolean indicating perfect structural match |

### Evaluation Metrics

**Jaccard Similarity**: Intersection over union of predicted and target base-pair sets
- 1.0 = Perfect match
- 0.0 = No overlap

**SHAPE Profile**: Predicted reactivity values (0-2+)
- Higher values indicate greater nucleotide flexibility/accessibility
- Typically unpaired positions have SHAPE > 0.5
- Typically paired positions have SHAPE < 0.25

## Algorithm Details

### Sequence Generation Pipeline

1. **Initial Sampling** (default: 128 sequences per structure):
   - **Greedy sampling** with p=0.05 (low exploration)
   - **Greedy sampling** with p=0.1 (moderate exploration)
   - **Stochastic sampling** with p=1.0 (high diversity)
   - **Optional beam search** (GPU 0 only, if enabled)

2. **Structure Prediction**: 
   - Each generated sequence is folded using the environment's structure predictor (RibonanzaNet-SS)
   - SHAPE reactivity profiles computed using RibonanzaNet
   - Base pairs extracted via Hungarian matching algorithm

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Calculate Jaccard similarity between predicted and target base pairs
   - Compute OpenKnot score (if SHAPE constraints enabled)

4. **Rescue Mechanism** (applied if Jaccard < 1.0):
   - Identify positions where predicted structure differs from target
   - If ≤4 differing positions: enumerate all valid nucleotide combinations
   - Re-evaluate mutated sequences
   - Select best-performing sequence

5. **Selection**: Choose sequence with highest Jaccard similarity

### Deep Q-Learning Framework

The model was trained using a variant of Deep Q-Learning with:
- **Twice-shifted action value training** for autoregressive generation
- **Position-dependent reward** based on structural correctness and SHAPE compliance
- **Exponential reward reweighting** to encourage near-perfect → perfect transitions
- **Linearly decayed discount factor** (γ_t) to emphasize early position decisions

### Wildtype Sequence Bias

When `wild_type_sequence` is provided:
- Random upweighting bias sampled uniformly between 0.75-1.0
- Balances similarity to wildtype with structural accuracy
- Applied through weighted sampling during sequence generation

## Performance Metrics

The tool reports:
- Average Jaccard similarity across all designs
- Number of perfectly solved structures (Jaccard = 1.0)
- Hamming distance from wildtype sequence
- Total runtime

## Model Architecture

- **Paired/Unpaired Encoding**: Binary structural conditioning
- **LSTM Positional Encoding**: Learned positional information
- **Causal 1D Convolution**: Ensures autoregressive decoding
- **Causal Transformer Decoder** (6 layers): 
  - Masked self-attention
  - Encoder-decoder cross-attention
  - Position-wise feedforward layers
  - Key-value caching for efficient inference
- **Output Projection**: Hidden states → Q-values over {A, U, G, C}

### Architecture Specifications
- **Embedding Size**: 384
- **Attention Heads**: 16
- **Encoder Layers**: 6
- **Decoder Layers**: 6
- **Feedforward Dimension**: 1536 (4× embedding size)

- **Training Data**: Human genome scanned in 240mer windows (stride=50)

### Key Findings
- **Struct2SeQ-SHAPE** generates sequences with better OpenKnot scores (experimental SHAPE compliance)
- **SHAPE constraints** are critical for experimental performance

- Explores substantially larger sequence space than human-designed solutions

## Tips for Best Results

1. **GPU Memory**: Batch size automatically set to 32 for structure prediction
2. **Rescue Mechanism**: Most effective for near-matches (≤4 differing positions)
3. **Sampling Diversity**: Uses 3-4 different sampling strategies for robust coverage
4. **Wildtype Bias**: Adjust `up_bias` range (0.75-1.0) for different conservation levels

## Troubleshooting

- **CUDA Out of Memory**: Reduce batch size in structure prediction sections
- **Missing Modules**: Ensure all custom modules are in Python path
- **Model Not Found**: Verify `policy_network.pt` exists in working directory
- **Invalid Structures**: Check dot-bracket notation is properly formatted
